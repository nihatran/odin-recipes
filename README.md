# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is the first project of The Odin Project Foundations Course. 
It covers basic HTML concepts. By creating a simple website featuring three recipes, 
I reviewed the HTML boilerplate, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and images. 
I also familiarized myself with the basic git workflow and improved at writing commit messages.
