        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled meat was cooked in episode 7 of Laid-Back Camp.
        Rin and Nadeshiko made this meal during a camping trip at Lake Shibire, where a legendary cow spirit resides.<br>
        This savory dish is quick to make, and the marinade reminds one of Japan (*^â–½^*)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4-6 pork belly kabobs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp shoyu</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the pork belly kabobs in shoyu and mirin for 30 minutes to an hour</li>
            <li>Grill the meats on your equipment of choice, turning the skewers every few minutes</li>
            <li>Cook until the meat is a nice brown, and you're done!</li>
        </ol>
