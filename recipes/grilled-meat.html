        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled meat was cooked in episode 7 of Laid-Back Camp.
        Rin and Nadeshiko made this meal during a camping trip at Lake Shibire, where a legendary cow spirit resides.</p>
        <p>This savory dish is quick to make, and the marinade reminds one of Japan (*^▽^*)</p>
